# Setup checklist — what to gather

Everything the bot needs before the first run, in the order it's easiest to
collect. Each item says exactly where to get it and which `.env` line it goes
on (see README §1.3 for the full table).

1. **Telegram bot token.** Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in
   Telegram, send `/newbot`, answer the name and username prompts, and copy
   the token it prints (`123456789:AA...`). Create a new bot; don't reuse an
   existing one's token. → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

2. **Your Telegram user id.** Open [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
   and send it anything; it replies with your numeric id. The bot answers
   only this user. → `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`

3. **The private group with topics.** In Telegram: New Group → name it → add
   any placeholder member (you can remove them after) → open the group's
   settings → Edit → turn on **Topics**. Add your bot to the group and
   promote it to admin (group settings → Administrators → Add Admin)
   **first**, so it sees every topic get created. Then create one topic per
   course plus `Assignments`, `Exams` and `Review`, naming each as you go —
   the bot binds itself from the name and replies in the topic to confirm
   (README §7). Only a topic created before the bot joined needs `/bind` run
   inside it as a fallback. Nothing to put in `.env` — the bindings live in
   `knowledge/channels.md`. Telegram only lets a bot download files up to
   20 MB, so split anything bigger before sending it; the bot says so
   instead of ingesting it.

4. **Fireworks API key.** Sign in at
   [app.fireworks.ai](https://app.fireworks.ai) → click your account (top
   right) → **API Keys** → create a key and copy it once; it isn't shown
   again. → `FALLBACK_API_KEY` (with
   `FALLBACK_BASE_URL=https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`)

5. **Fireworks model id.** At
   [app.fireworks.ai/models](https://app.fireworks.ai/models), filter for
   **function calling** support and pick a Qwen3 variant to stay closest to
   the local model. The id on the model's page looks like
   `accounts/fireworks/models/<name>` — copy it verbatim. →
   `FALLBACK_MODEL`; optionally also pick a vision-capable model (filter:
   vision) for `FALLBACK_VISION_MODEL`

   Three roles share this one Fireworks account, each with its own id from
   [app.fireworks.ai/models](https://app.fireworks.ai/models): `FALLBACK_MODEL`
   is a Flash-sized model that keeps behavior closest to the Spark,
   `FALLBACK_VISION_MODEL` is a Flash-sized vision model (e.g. GLM 5.3
   Flash), and `HARD_MODEL` is a strong model for `/hard` (e.g. GLM 5.3 or
   Kimi K3) — copy the exact id from that page for each, verbatim.

   **Thinking on Fireworks models.** The thinking switch differs per model
   family — open the model's page on
   [app.fireworks.ai](https://app.fireworks.ai), find its reasoning/thinking
   parameter, and paste it as JSON into the matching `*_EXTRA_BODY` variable
   (`FALLBACK_EXTRA_BODY`, `HARD_EXTRA_BODY`, `FALLBACK_VISION_EXTRA_BODY`).
   Recommended: thinking on for `HARD_MODEL`, off for `FALLBACK_MODEL`.

6. **Digital Ocean droplet details.** From the droplet's page in the DO
   console: its public IPv4 address and the SSH user you created (usually
   `root` or your own user). SSH in and note `nproc` (cores — 4+ means you
   can run the `small` Whisper model), `free -h` (RAM) and
   `lsb_release -a` (Ubuntu version; 24.04 LTS is what `deploy/install.sh`
   assumes). Install Tailscale there with the one-liner from
   [tailscale.com/download/linux](https://tailscale.com/download/linux),
   then `sudo tailscale up` and follow the printed login URL. →
   `KNOWLEDGE_DIR`, `DATA_DIR`, `KOKORO_MODEL_DIR` all live under this
   user's home directory.

7. **The Spark's Tailscale hostname.** On the Spark, `tailscale status`
   prints its MagicDNS name and `100.x.y.z` address — either works. vLLM
   must listen on the Tailscale interface, not just localhost: publish the
   port as `-p 8888:8888` (not `-p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888`) and confirm from
   the droplet with `curl -s http://<spark-hostname>:8888/v1/models`. →
   `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://<spark-hostname>:8888/v1`, `VISION_BASE_URL` the
   same, plus `CHAT_MODEL` / `VISION_MODEL` matching what the Spark serves.

8. **The Spark bare repo.** On the Spark:
   `git init --bare ~/backups/knowledge.git`. → first entry of
   `KNOWLEDGE_REMOTES`, as `<spark-user>@<spark-hostname>:backups/knowledge.git`

9. **The Mac bare repo.** On the Mac, the same command:
   `git init --bare ~/backups/knowledge.git`. The Mac needs Tailscale
   running and Remote Login enabled (System Settings → General → Sharing →
   turn on Remote Login) so it accepts SSH over the tailnet. → second entry
   of `KNOWLEDGE_REMOTES`, as `<mac-user>@<mac-hostname>:backups/knowledge.git`

10. **Droplet's SSH key on both remotes.** On the droplet, run
    `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` with no passphrase (systemd runs the push
    unattended), then append `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to
    `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on both the Spark and the Mac. →
    `KNOWLEDGE_REMOTES=<spark-user>@<spark-hostname>:backups/knowledge.git,<mac-user>@<mac-hostname>:backups/knowledge.git`

    Why not GitHub? A private GitHub repo is still plaintext to GitHub, and
    this bundle holds home address, schedule, health and school data — so
    backups go only to machines the owner controls.

11. **Backblaze B2 for the nightly `restic` backup.**
    [backblaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com) → **B2 Cloud Storage** →
    create a bucket (private) → **Application Keys** → create a new key
    scoped to that bucket. On the droplet, create
    `~/telegramManager/.restic.env` (mode 600) with:
    `RESTIC_REPOSITORY=b2:<bucket>:assistant`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD` (a new
    passphrase for the repo, or `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` pointing at one),
    `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY` from the application key. Run
    `restic init` once (see `deploy/backup.sh` header), then add its cron
    line. Restore with `restic restore latest --target /path`.

12. **Google Maps key (optional).**
    [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → pick or
    create a project → **APIs & Services** → **Library**: enable both the
    **Geocoding API** and the **Directions API** → **Credentials** →
    Create credentials → API key, and restrict it to those two APIs.
    Without it, travel time falls back to each event's stored
    `travel_minutes`. → `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill those lines in, `chmod 600 .env`,
and follow README §1.5.
